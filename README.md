# INFO

Each one of you will get an email or facebook meessage with your unique ID. This IS important.

Probably you didn't have so amazing recruitment experience ever :) But I must do this that way, because, there's 
twenty five of you. So I need to put minimum effort in this recruitment process. I've decided not to reject a single 
application on the first (CV) level.

At junior level - you can be overwhelmed a little bit with this README and tasks :) But do not worry - Just do, there's 
no try. And I think that if you're smart guy or lady - you really can resolve all this - including the learing 
of how to make git pull request in the given time;

(this QR code on img is meaningless - really ;) )

# RULES

1. Task can be found in the tasks/tasks.py file.
2. Using your ID - create a file under solutions python package, with name: `<ID>.py`; If your ID is 
 `nice_diamond` the file name will be: `nice_diamond.py`
3. Do not push changes to master branch! Create a branch which is called the same as your ID - and then create a 
 PR (pull request) to master branch.
4. Deadline for creating a PR: 02.06.2016 23:59:59 - this is very serious.
5. You can ask me only! one and only one! question if you want - so be very careful with this.
 
# WHAT NEXT?

1. Until next sunday evening - this README will be updated with junior dev ranking.
2. The most 3-4 will be asked to make a call or meeting with me. 

### Enjoy. Happy coding.
